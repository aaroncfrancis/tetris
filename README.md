<h1>Tetris Game</h1>
This is a game project that I built using Pygame and some other libraries. I followed a tutorial on YouTube for the most part, but I made sure to understand every part of the code and used it as a way to learn and improve my programming skills. I also added my own flair to the game and learned a lot about object-oriented programming (OOP) along the way.

<h1>About the Game</h1>
This game is a replica of the original Tetris created by Alexey Pajitnov. Blocks fall at random from the top of a grid, and the user must place them accordingly. Completing rows will delete the blocks on that row and everything will shift down a row. The objective of the game is to last as long as you can without the blocks overflowing and reaching the top. 

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
<h2>Pygame</h2> A popular Python library for building 2D games, which provides a variety of functions and tools for creating game graphics, handling user input, and managing game logic.
<h2>Other Python Libraries</h2> I used other Python libraries such as random, pathlib, mixer
<h2>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h2> I utilized OOP concepts such as classes, objects, and inheritance to structure the game code and create reusable game objects, making the code more organized and maintainable.

What I Learned</h1>
<h2> Advanced Pygame Methods and Tools</h2> I gained a solid understanding of Pygame's key concepts, including game window creation, game loop, event handling, sprite rendering, and collision detection.
<h2> OOP Principles</h2> Through implementing classes and objects, I learned how to encapsulate game logic into classes and use inheritance to create reusable code. This helped me achieve a modular and structured codebase.
<h2> Game Development Workflow</h2> I learned about the game development workflow, including designing game assets, implementing game logic, debugging and testing, and iterating on the game to improve its functionality and gameplay. While following the tutorial, I added my own creative elements to the game, such as customizing the game's appearance, implementing additional game features, and enhancing the gameplay experience with sound effects and visual effects.

<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
I would like to thank the YouTube tutorial from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CoderSpaceChannel">Coder Space</a> that I followed for providing a tutorial for building this game. The tutorial helped me understand the basic concepts of game development using Pygame and sparked my interest in exploring further on my own. I also appreciate the Pygame community for providing helpful documentation and examples that aided my learning process.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
Building this game using Pygame has been a challenging yet rewarding experience. I am proud of the skills I have gained in OOP programming and Pygame development, and I am excited to continue exploring and improving my game development skills in the future. I hope you enjoy playing the game and appreciate the effort and creativity that I have put into it!
